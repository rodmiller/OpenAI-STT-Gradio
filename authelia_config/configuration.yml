## set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
jwt_secret: 78sfdgg3t3gwv7avjheh43

## Default redirection URL
##
## If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia does not know where to redirect the user to at the end
## of the authentication process. This parameter allows you to specify the default redirection URL Authelia will use
## in such a case.
##
## Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't be redirected upon successful authentication.
default_redirection_url: https://dictaphone.flyingcrank.com

##
## Server Configuration
##
server:
  ## The address to listen on.
  host: 0.0.0.0

  enable_pprof: false
  ## Enables the expvars endpoint.
  enable_expvars: false
  ## Disables writing the health check vars to /app/.healthcheck.env which makes healthcheck.sh return exit code 0.
  ## This is disabled by default if either /app/.healthcheck.env or /app/healthcheck.sh do not exist.
  disable_healthcheck: false

  ## Authelia by default doesn't accept TLS communication on the server port. This section overrides this behaviour.
  tls:
    ## The path to the DER base64/PEM format private key.
    key: ""
    ## The path to the DER base64/PEM format public certificate.
    certificate: ""

##
## Telemetry Configuration
##
telemetry:
  ##
  ## Metrics Configuration
  ##
  metrics:
    ## Enable Metrics.

    address: tcp://0.0.0.0:9959

##
## TOTP Configuration
##
## Parameters used for TOTP generation.
totp:
  ## Disable TOTP.
  disable: false

  ## The issuer name displayed in the Authenticator application of your choice.
  issuer: authelia.com

  ## The TOTP algorithm to use.
  ## It is CRITICAL you read the documentation before changing this option:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/c/totp#algorithm
  algorithm: sha1

  ## The number of digits a user has to input. Must either be 6 or 8.
  ## Changing this option only affects newly generated TOTP configurations.
  ## It is CRITICAL you read the documentation before changing this option:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/c/totp#digits
  digits: 6

  ## The period in seconds a one-time password is valid for.
  ## Changing this option only affects newly generated TOTP configurations.
  period: 30

  ## The skew controls number of one-time passwords either side of the current one that are valid.
  ## Warning: before changing skew read the docs link below.
  skew: 1
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/totp#input-validation to read
  ## the documentation.

  ## The size of the generated shared secrets. Default is 32 and is sufficient in most use cases, minimum is 20.
  secret_size: 32

##
## WebAuthn Configuration
##
## Parameters used for WebAuthn.
webauthn:
  ## Disable Webauthn.
  disable: false
  ## Adjust the interaction timeout for Webauthn dialogues.
  timeout: 60s
  ## The display name the browser should show the user for when using Webauthn to login/register.
  display_name: Authelia
  ## Conveyance preference controls if we collect the attestation statement including the AAGUID from the device.

##
## NTP Configuration
##
## This is used to validate the servers time is accurate enough to validate TOTP.
ntp:
  ## NTP server address.
  address: "time.cloudflare.com:123"
  ## NTP version.
  version: 4
  ## Maximum allowed time offset between the host and the NTP server.
  max_desync: 3s
  ## Disables the NTP check on startup entirely. This means Authelia will not contact a remote service at all if you
  ## set this to true, and can operate in a truly offline mode.
  disable_startup_check: false
  ## The default of false will prevent startup only if we can contact the NTP server and the time is out of sync with
  ## the NTP server more than the configured max_desync. If you set this to true, an error will be logged but startup
  ## will continue regardless of results.
  disable_failure: false

authentication_backend:

    ## Configures the minimum score allowed.
    min_score: 3

##
## Access Control Configuration
##
## Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one resource to users or group of users.
##
access_control:
  ## Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'. It is the policy applied to any
  ## resource if there is no policy to be applied to the user.
  default_policy: deny

  rules:
    ## bypass rule
    - domain: 'dictaphoneauth.flyingcrank.com' #This should be your authentication URL
      policy: bypass
    - domain: 'www.flyingcrank.com'
      resources:
        - '/.client/manifest.json$'
        - '/.client/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+.png$'
        - '/service_worker.js$'
      policy: bypass
    - domain: 'dictaphone.flyingcrank.com'
      subject:
        - 'group:admins'
      policy: one_factor

##
## Session Provider Configuration
##
## The session cookies identify the user once logged in.
## The available providers are: `memory`, `redis`. Memory is the provider unless redis is defined.
session:
  ## The name of the session cookie.
  name: authelia_session
  ## The domain to protect.
  ## Note: the authenticator must also be in that domain.
  ## If empty, the cookie is restricted to the subdomain of the issuer.
  domain: flyingcrank.com
  ## Sets the Cookie SameSite value. Possible options are none, lax, or strict.
  ## Please read https://www.authelia.com/c/session#same_site
  same_site: lax
  ## The secret to encrypt the session data. This is only used with Redis / Redis Sentinel.
  ## Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
  secret: 3sdffgsdgs33452j2jhgjs9gdfg
  ## The value for expiration, inactivity, and remember_me_duration are in seconds or the duration notation format.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ## All three of these values affect the cookie/session validity period. Longer periods are considered less secure
  ## because a stolen cookie will last longer giving attackers more time to spy or attack.
  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS NOT selected.
  expiration: 1h
  ## The inactivity time before the session is reset. If expiration is set to 1h, and this is set to 5m, if the user
  ## does not select the remember me option their session will get destroyed after 1h, or after 5m since the last time
  ## Authelia detected user activity.
  inactivity: 5m
  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS selected.
  ## Value of -1 disables remember me.
  remember_me_duration: 12M

##
## Regulation Configuration
##
## This mechanism prevents attackers from brute forcing the first factor. It bans the user if too many attempts are made
## in a short period of time.
regulation:
  ## The number of failed login attempts before user is banned. Set it to 0 to disable regulation.
  max_retries: 3
  ## The time range during which the user can attempt login before being banned. The user is banned if the
  ## authentication failed 'max_retries' times in a 'find_time' seconds window. Find Time accepts duration notation.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  find_time: 2m
  ## The length of time before a banned user can login again. Ban Time accepts duration notation.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ban_time: 5m

##
## Storage Provider Configuration
##
## The available providers are: `local`, `mysql`, `postgres`. You must use one and only one of these providers.
storage:
  local:
    path: /config/db.sqlite3 #this is your databse. You could use a mysql database if you wanted, but we're going to use this one.
  encryption_key: 345f2f5v6c54vg2ewesd

##
## Notification Provider
##
## Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a Webauthn registration or a TOTP registration.
## The available providers are: filesystem, smtp. You must use only one of these providers.
notifier:
  ## You can disable the notifier startup check by setting this to true.
  disable_startup_check: true #true/false
  smtp:
    username: user@gmail.com #your email address
    password: apppassword #your email password
    host: smtp.gmail.com #email smtp server
    port: 587 #email smtp port
    sender: user@gmail.com
    subject: "[Authelia] {title}" #email subject
